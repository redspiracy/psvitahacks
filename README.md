PSVita on firmware 3.70 now is exploited! you can read at link above. But, for some people that has PSVita on 3.70 firmware, unfortunately can't fullfil the `Requirement` step because they can't access the PlayStation Store that says 'You must update the system software'.
As we know, on link above written `'Your device must be able to access the PlayStation Store.'`
Here is the simple tutorial:
```
1. Go to Settings.
2. Go to Network > Wi-Fi Settings.
3. Select your access point, and open Advanced Settings menu.
4. On the Proxy Server change from 'Do Not Use' to 'Use'.
5. After changed it, fill the Address with '212.47.229.76' and fill the Port with 80.
6. Select OK.
```
Now, you can access PlayStation Store!
But, if you want to download anything on PlayStation Store, you must do this step:
```
1. Press PlayStation button.
2. Go to Settings.
3. Go to Network > Wi-Fi Settings.
4. Select your access point, and open Advanced Settings menu.
5. On the Proxy Server change from 'Use' to 'Do Not Use'.
